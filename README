# crosscram-ws

A web service API for crosscram [https://github.com/baznex/crosscram](https://github.com/baznex/crosscram).

## Usage

Currently, there is no released version of the crosscram lib.  The crosscram-ws project file currently references the '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT' version of crosscram so you'll have to clone the crosscram repository and 'lein install' it.  Be sure to update the version in the project file if you clone a version other than the one listed.

To start the web server, run

    lein run <port-num>
