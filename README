# crosscram-ws

A web service API for crosscram (https://github.com/baznex/crosscram).

## Usage

To start the web server, run

    lein run <port-num>

Currently, the only access to the web service is through the "/game" path
segment.  It simply returns a pprinted string of the game object returned when
a game is played between two instances of the random bot on a board of 8 rows
and 8 columns.
